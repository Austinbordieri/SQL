## I was tasked with creating querires in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data in this SQL.

# Question 1 - How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)

# Question 2 -How many of those orders were for an iphone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)

AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# Question 3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# Question 4 - Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;  

# Question 5 - What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product <> ''
AND product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY product;

# Question 6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Licoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many opf each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue, 
location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

# Question 7 - How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT

avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# Question 8 - List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold

SELECT Product, location, sum(Quantity)

GROUP BY Product;

# Question 9 - Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

# Question 10 - How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?

SELECT

GROUP BY Product;

# Question 11 - What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(c.acctnum) 
FROM FebSales as f
LEFT JOIN customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# Question 12 - What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(c.acctnum)

# Question 13 - Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
