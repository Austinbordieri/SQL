#Tasked with a new database to assess my skill with sql I came up and queried the following scenarios and results

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT 
FirstName,LastName,
CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT 
*
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers as c
LEFT JOIN invoices as i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil' ;

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent' ;

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.LastName, e.Firstname, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices I ON I.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, 
c.FirstName, c.LastName, 
c.Country,  i.Total
FROM customers as c
JOIN invoices as i ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees as e ON e.EmployeeID = c.SupportRepId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) as 'Total Sales'
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name
FROM invoice_items as i
LEFT JOIN tracks as t ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT a.name as artist, t.name as track, i.invoicelineid
FROM invoice_items as i
LEFT JOIN tracks as t ON i.trackid = t.trackid
JOIN  albums as alb ON t.albumid = alb.albumid
JOIN artists as a ON alb.artistid = a.artistid;

#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name as Track, a.title as Album, 
g.name as Genre, m.name as Media_Type
FROM tracks as t
LEFT JOIN albums as a ON t.albumid = a.albumid
LEFT JOIN media_types as m ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
LEFT JOIN genres as g ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.lastname, ROUND (sum(i.total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM invoices as i
LEFT JOIN customers as c ON i.customerid = c.customerid
LEFT JOIN employees as e ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
Group by e.firstname;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(sum(i.total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees as e 
JOIN customers as c ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices as i ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' desc LIMIT 1;
